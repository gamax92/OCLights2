OCLights 2 is a Open Source Minecraft mod that adds a Peripheral for OpenComputers. The GPU Peripheral is capable of rendering draw commands and outputting them to a Monitor, which has a right clickable GUI to use your mouse and keyboard to control actions. This gives a whole new experience for OpenComputers.
